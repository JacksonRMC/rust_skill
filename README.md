# Merkle Trees and Hashing Implementation

This project demonstrates proficiency in implementing Merkle trees and hashing algorithms in Rust. It showcases various aspects of cryptographic data structures and their applications.

## Overview

Merkle trees are fundamental data structures in cryptography and distributed systems. They allow for efficient and secure verification of large data sets. This implementation focuses on:

1. Basic Merkle tree construction
2. Proof generation and validation
3. Compact multiproof generation and validation

## Key Components

### Hashing

- Utilizes Rust's built-in hashing function (`std::hash::Hash`)
- Implements a custom `HashValue` type (alias for `u64`)
- Provides a helper function `hash<T: Hash>(t: &T) -> HashValue` for easy hashing

### Merkle Tree Construction

- Implements `pad_base_layer` to ensure the number of leaf nodes is a power of two
- Uses `concatenate_hash_values` to combine hashes of child nodes
- Calculates Merkle root with `calculate_merkle_root`

### Proof Generation and Validation

- Generates Merkle proofs for individual words in a sentence
- Validates proofs without knowledge of the entire data set
- Implements `SiblingNode` enum to represent left and right siblings in the proof

### Compact Multiproof

- Implements space-efficient proofs for multiple entries in a Merkle tree
- Uses `CompactMerkleMultiProof` struct to store leaf indices and necessary hashes
- Provides functions for generating and validating compact multiproofs
